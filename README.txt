SoundWaveShare - SWS

Description:
Welcome to SWS! This is a music based social media type app that was created to connect
users with their favorite music, artists, etc. SWS has the ability to allow users to create posts for their favorite song at the moment. Users can also see the most recent and up to date posts. Users also have the ability to listen the the music videos attatched. Users can log in or sign up to be appart of SWS.

To Run:
1. npm i
2. npm run seed
3. You may also need to add your DB_PASSWORD in the .env file 
4. npm run start

Problems:
I definitely had trouble in some areas. First, I'd love to modify this application to give the ability to comment in real time on other posts, I wasn't able to figure that out. I'd also love to give the users the ability to upload their own music videos when posting but I'm not sure if I need to use another API to do that; cloudinary only allows users to upload photos.

Resources used:
I used past class resources: ICPS, HWs, etc. to guide me and I also used resources online like W3Schools, web.dev, etc when I needed them. I did not recieve help.

Technologies used:
Javascript, Handlebars, CSS, Node, Express, Sequelize, Cloudinary API, mySQL, Bootstrap, jQuery, HTML
